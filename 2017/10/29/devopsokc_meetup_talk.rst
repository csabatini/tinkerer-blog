DevopsOKC Meetup Talk
======================

My colleague John Wassilak and I recently had the opportunity to present at the `DevopOKC <https://www.meetup.com/DevopsOKC/events/244081796/>`_ meetup on 10/20/2017. 

Summary
-------
The talk covers the basics of `HashiCorp Terraform <https://www.terraform.io>`_, the tech initiatives at Sonic Drive-In, and how we use Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code solution for our Big Data platform on AWS.

I did a quick demo using Terraform to provision two Linux servers, you can view the `source <https://github.com/csabatini/terraform-meetup-demo>`_ for that on GitHub. We also discussed some advanced features like re-useable modules and remote state. If you're new to Terraform, I hope you find some of our lessons learned helpful in your own scripting.
