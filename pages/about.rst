Hi, my name is Caleb Sabatini. I'm a Data Engineer living in Oklahoma City; recently, I've been building automated data pipelines for batch and streaming workloads.

I'm a user of open-source software like the Apache Hadoop stack, Apache Spark, and Apache Airflow. I'm also interested in DevOps practices like CICD and Infrastructure as Code.
