Hi, I'm Caleb Sabatini, a Data Engineer living in Oklahoma City. I build automated data pipelines for batch and streaming workloads.

In my work, I use open-source software like the Apache Hadoop stack, Apache Spark, and Apache Airflow. I'm also interested in DevOps practices like CICD and Infrastructure as Code.
